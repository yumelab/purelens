# PureLens

An Android app designed to help you declutter your gallery by removing unused, duplicate, blurry, and unwanted images, freeing up valuable storage space. Powered by AI-driven image scoring, the app lets you easily swipe left to discard or right to keep your favorite photos, similar to a Tinder-like gesture. Images are not permanently deleted but are moved to a trash folder, giving you the flexibility to review and restore them later before final deletion.
